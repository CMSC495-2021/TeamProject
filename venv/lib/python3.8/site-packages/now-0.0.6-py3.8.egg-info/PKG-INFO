Description: now
        ===
        
        This is a command-line tool for tracking what you're doing as simply as
        possible. It's for people who just want to describe what's going on and move on
        without messing with a 'system'.
        
        Currently it's in a raw, early stage.
        If you keep a file named ~/.now.txt for any other purpose, don't use this.
        
        Example::
        
            now eating lunch
            now napping
        
        These commands append lines to ~/.now.txt, prefixed with timestamps.
        
        If you want to use a different file instead of ~/.now.txt,
        create a file called ~/.nowrc with content like the following
        (where ~/bar is the name of the file you want to have written)::
        
            write_to=~/bar
        
        Give an absolute path. A relative path will generate an error.
        
        
        Principles:
        
        * Switches should not be required in normal operation.
        * The default action is to write the given message with a timestamp.
        * We don't write to multiple different files. Just one file.
        * Messages are not parsed; they have no syntax, and no reserved words.
        * Messages have no imposed inter-relationships.
        * Always write with UTF-8 encoding.
        * Always write the same line-based format.
        * The line format should be both obvious to humans and easily machine-parseable
          (e.g, with regex).
        * Times are always given in UTC, with largest unit first (e.g. year-month-day).
        * Times are never tracked below the duration of 1 second.
        * `now` doesn't get involved in analyzing or rendering the data it produces.
        
        If you are interested in a fancier tool (written in Ruby and writing
        a customizable TaskPaper format), take a look at
